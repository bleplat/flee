# Flee
A game I made a while ago when I was learning vb.NET
Run on MS Windows only.

## Progress
I recently translated the project to C#.
I am cleaning the code and preparing to add multiplayer.
~~I have no intention to improve it substantially~~ Ok, a little bit...

## Features
This is a simple 2D spaceship strategy game.
You spawn as a faction, and you have to reach 'ascention' by collecting a huge amount of resources.
To achieve this goal, you need to exterminate your enemies, with the help of allied factions.
Do not loose time, as your foe will quickly rise in power.
Bosses will randomly spawn, just to make your task a little bit harder.

## Usage
A .exe binary is available in Flee, but you can always compile it yourself, in which case, the compiled program is outputed to Flee/bin/x64/Release and should be run inside Flee/.
