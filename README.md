# Flee
A game I made a while ago when I was learning vb.NET

## Progress
I am working on other projects and **I have no intention to improve it substantially**.

I will finish it, make the project cleaner, an translate it to C#.

## Features
This is a simple 2D spaceship strategy game.
You spawn as a faction, and you have to reach 'ascention' by collecting a huge amount of resources.
To achieve this goal, you need to exterminate your enemies, with the help of allied factions.
Do not loose time, as your foe will quickly rise in power.
Bosses will randomly spawn, just to make your task a little bit harder.
